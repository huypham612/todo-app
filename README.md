# Focus7 - Minimal TODO App

A minimal PWA with a 7-task limit and Pomodoro timer, seamlessly integrates with [Clarity7](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/83db0d97-97df-4c9f-ac28-d627c6001898), an AI-powered priority finder, to transform decision paralysis into focused action using AI and cognitive science.

## Why 7 Tasks?

Research-backed limit based on Miller's Rule - people can effectively focus on 7Â±2 items. This forces prioritization and prevents overwhelm, leading to higher completion rates.
